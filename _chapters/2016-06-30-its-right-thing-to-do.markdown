1. It is worth investing in a system which will give really low launch costs, as it will pay off in the long run, such as Startram or (if it could be made fail safe) Launchloop. 
2. Build a starter habitat, with materials from Earth.
3. Develop mining of near earth asteroids, and process on the starter habitat to steel, plastic and water. 
5. Then build a first large scale habitat. Over time space built components will replace those brought from Earth. 

A manned landing on Mars,or a Moonbase, currently targets, are expensive distractions from this. 

The total cost (ballpark, remember) is around $350 billion, as shown in the chart below. 
To put this in perspective:
Apollo programme (in 2019 $)       $290bn 
US military budget 2019            $673bn 
Chinese investment in high         $300bn 
speed rail to date 
Global investment in airports      $319 bn
