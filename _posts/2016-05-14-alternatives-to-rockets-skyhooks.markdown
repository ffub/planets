Things get much easier if a space elevator cable does not reach the ground, then it can be constructed with current materials. This is the [Skyhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure)) concept. A supersonic vehicle (wholly or partly air breathing) would connect with a tether hanging down from a satellite  (connecting at a speed of Mach 10 or higher? It's relative velocity that matters, and in flight refuelling at high speed is well proven).

The two options are a fixed tether ( basically, a short space elevator) along which the space ship would crawl up (how? Linear motors?). The alternative is a rotating tether, which would slingshot the spaceship into orbit, as shown in the diagram below:

Studies by Boeing suggest that a rotating tether is more efficient than a fixed one, but this technology allows one to start small and then work out which is best in practice. With a rotating tether, Newtonâ€™s third law still applies, and the reaction to the slingshot would lower the anchoring satellite, which would need to lifted back up, possibly through [electrodynamics](http://www.space.com/521-electrodynamic-tethers-swing.html).

One could start connecting with a launch vehicle at a relatively high level and a connecting speed of Mach 10 or higher, then with experience and developing skyhook materials, making the cable longer and connecting at lower altitude and at lower speeds; Mach 5 or lower could be achieved with airbreathing scramjets, at much lower cost than with rockets. Eventually and gradually, learning as one goes along, skyhooks may evolve into fully fledged space elevators.
