The Earth’s magnetic field protects us from most cosmic and solar radiation, by the [Van Allen belts][van-allen-belts] which they generate. Outside these, protection is needed, otherwise the levels of exposure are dangerous.

O’Neill thought that a 2 metre depth of  lunar regolith, as soil, would be sufficient to protect from radiation. He was wrong, regolith  is pretty useless for radiation shielding. Metals like steel and aluminium are not much better. That is because they contain heavier elements which re-emit powerful charged particles when they absorb cosmic radiation. What is needed is lighter elements, which absorb without re-emission, preferably a high content of hydrogen.

A good candidate is water (which is why spent nuclear fuel rods are immersed in it). [A metre depth of water would suffice][depth]. The other contributor is not to make the habitat shell in metal, but in a [high hydrogen content plastic][plastic]. Polythene is perfect,  not strong enough in its normal form, but NASA is developing a cross linked variant called RXF1 which is as strong as steel , and there are variants like this already available.  That brings other problems: the outside temperature of a habitat would be over 100C in sunlight (enough to melt the material) and below -100 in shade (which would cause embrittlement). Also abrasion from micrometeorites could be worse than with a metal skin. It may be what is needed is an outer shell in steel (coated on the inside to prevent corrosion), then a layer of water, then an inner skin in plastic. Finally there is the possibility of creating a magnetic field around  a habitat, a [miniature version of the Van Allen belts][mini-van-allen-belts].

It’s trial and error, indeed applying all of the above may be overkill. One project which would be useful would be a Mars mission, it is clear that on such a long trip astronauts cannot go in a aluminium shell like the ISS (the latter is protected by being below the Van Allen belts). NASA is looking at a plastic spaceship, although how they will get it into orbit without melting… it could certainly not survive re-entry to Earth.
