<br /><div class="MsoNormal">Things get much easier if a space elevator cable does not reach the ground, then it can be constructed with current materials. This is the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure)"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;">skyhook</span></a>concept. A supersonic vehicle (wholly or partly air breathing) would connect with a tether hanging down from a satellite &nbsp;(connecting at a speed of Mach 10 or higher? It’s relative velocity that matters, and in flight refuelling at high speed is well proven). <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The two options are a fixed tether ( basically, a short space elevator) along which the space ship would crawl up (how? Linear motors?). The alternative is a rotating tether, which would slingshot the spaceship into orbit, as shown in the diagram below:<o:p></o:p></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZsW7LajyuQ/Vzdlgy7EfII/AAAAAAAAAFY/PGeHGcXuaUMtCCZS9X-mlzF2eUa3RVtxACLcB/s1600/skyhook%2Brotating.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="338" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZsW7LajyuQ/Vzdlgy7EfII/AAAAAAAAAFY/PGeHGcXuaUMtCCZS9X-mlzF2eUa3RVtxACLcB/s640/skyhook%2Brotating.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Studies by Boeing suggest that a rotating tether is more efficient than a fixed one, but this technology allows one to start small and then work out which is best in practice. With a rotating tether, Newton’s third law still applies, and the reaction to the slingshot would lower the anchoring satellite, which would need to lifted back up, possibly through <span style="background-color: white;"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_tether">electrodynamics</a></span>. </span><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">One could start connecting with a launch vehicle at a relatively high level and a connecting speed of Mach 10 or higher, then with experience and developing skyhook materials, making the cable longer and connecting at lower altitude and at lower speeds; Mach 5 or lower &nbsp;could be achieved with airbreathing scramjets, at much lower cost than with rockets. Eventually and gradually, learning as one goes along, skyhooks may evolve into fully fledged space elevators.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div>
