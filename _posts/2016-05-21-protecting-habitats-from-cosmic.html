<div class="MsoNormal">The Earth’s magnetic field protects us from most cosmic and solar radiation, by the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt" style="background-color: white;"> Van Allen belts </a>which they generate. Outside these protection is needed, otherwise the levels of exposure are dangerous. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">O’Neill thought that a 2 metre depth of &nbsp;lunar regolith, as soil, would be sufficient to protect from radiation. He was wrong, regolith &nbsp;is pretty useless for radiation shielding. Metals like steel and aluminium are not much better. That is because they contain heavier elements which re-emit powerful charged particles when they absorb cosmic radiation. What is needed is lighter elements, which absorb without re-emission, preferably a high content of hydrogen. <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">A good candidate is water (which is why spent nuclear fuel rods are immersed in it).<a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1336/what-thickness-depth-of-water-would-be-required-to-provide-radiation-shielding-i"> A metre depth of water would suffice.</a> The other contributor is not to make the habitat shell in metal, <a href="https://www.theengineer.co.uk/plastic-spaceships/">but in a high hydrogen content plastic.</a> Polythene is perfect, &nbsp;not strong enough in its normal form, but NASA is developing a cross linked variant called RXF1 which is as strong as steel , and there are variants like this already available. &nbsp;That brings other problems: the outside temperature of a habitat would be over 100C in sunlight (enough to melt the material) and below -100 in shade (which would cause embrittlement). Also abrasion from micrometeorites could be worse than with a metal skin. It may be what is needed is an outer shell in steel (coated on the inside to prevent corrosion), then a layer of water, then an inner skin in plastic. Finally there is the possibility of creating<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/108728/can-a-mega-magnetic-field-protect-astronauts-from-radiation/"> a magnetic field around&nbsp; a habitat, a miniature version of the Van Allen belts. </a><o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">It’s trial and error, indeed applying all of the above may be overkill. One project which would be useful would be a Mars mission, it is clear that on such a long trip astronauts cannot go in a aluminium shell like the ISS (the latter is protected by being below the Van Allen belts). NASA is looking at a plastic spaceship, although how they will get it into orbit without melting… it could certainly not survive re-entry to Earth.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div>
