<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">I am assuming that resources will be sourced from nearby locations in the solar system (with the Moon as first choice) for three reasons: <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="background-color: white;">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->The cost of getting anything in bulk up from Earth is very high<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="background-color: white;">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Environmental: a wish to expand mankind’s resources, not deplete the Earth further<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="background-color: white;">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;</span><!--[endif]-->Anything beyond Mars is expensive, long round trip and energy consumption. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">This section is based on current knowledge of Moon and Mars geology, which is still quite limited. The odds are that more resources will be discovered than are currently known. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><i>Metals: </i><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><b>Iron</b>: actually easier than on Earth. There appears to a lot of metallic iron in the lunar regolith, apparently of meteoric origin. Just sort through regolith with a magnet. If not, 15% of lunar maria (the flat regions) are iron oxide by weight, similar to iron ores on earth. <b>Nickel</b>and <b>chromium</b> ores seem plentiful as well, to make steel alloys and stainless steel. Lunar maria rocks contain a high concentration of <b>manganese</b>, the main alloying element used in steelmaking.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><b>Aluminium: </b>the usual ore on Earth (bauxite, essentially aluminium oxide) is not present on the moon. However anorthite (calcium aluminium silicate) is one of the most common rocks on the Moon. It can be smelted to its constituent metals using the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFC_Cambridge_process"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;">FFC Cambridge Process</span></a> , or some variant. As a by product, you also get calcium (to make lime, and hence mortar and concrete) and silicon (for solar panels). Calcium is an excellent electrical conductor, cannot be used on earth because it oxidises rapidly, but could work in the vacuum of space. This process is under development to find a better way to produce<b> titanium </b>metal, where earth ores are plentiful, but the current process is expensive and polluting. Ilmenite, the main titanium ore, has been found on the Moon. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">What the Moon is apparently short of is base metals (copper, lead, zinc). There are subsitutes e.g. aluminium for electrical uses, nickel or chromium instead of zinc galvanising for corrosion protecting steel. There may be resources on Mars, we don’t really know yet. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><i>Oxygen and organics: </i><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">O’Neill suggested that <b>oxygen</b>could be liberated from the oxides in the lunar regolith. That is indeed the case, but an easier alternative may be the huge amount of carbon dioxide present in the dense Venusian atmosphere. Venus may have gravity close to Earth, but all a collector vessel has to do is skim through the atmosphere, collect the carbon dioxide (</span>CO<sub>2</sub><span style="background-color: white;">) rich air (efficient storage would then freeze it, as dry ice) and skim out again – little extra energy (ΔV) would need to be expended.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">If you can separate the oxygen from&nbsp;</span>CO<sub>2</sub><span style="background-color: white;">, you also get </span><b>carbon</b><span style="background-color: white;"> or a carbon based organic (feedstock for plastics and other chemicals). You also get </span><b>sulphur</b><span style="background-color: white;"> from the sulphuric acid in Venusian air. Splitting&nbsp;</span>CO<sub>2</sub><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;takes quite a bit of energy – yet plants do it all the time, through photosynthesis.&nbsp; Natural photosynthesis (e.g using vats of algae) is slow and will not work with high concentrations of&nbsp;</span>CO<sub>2</sub><span style="background-color: white;">. However </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;"><a href="http://www.thegreenage.co.uk/tech/artificial-photosynthesis/">artificial photosynthesis</a></span><span style="background-color: white;"> is the subject of considerable research, potentially to provide solar power and to treat&nbsp;</span>CO<sub>2</sub><span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;rich flue gases from fossil fuel power stations.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b style="background-color: white;"><br /></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><b>Water</b> is the big one. Humans live in a totally water dependent environment. In a reasonably humid environment, 25% or more of the weight of topsoil is water, plus lakes, streams, drinking and washing, and a suggested water jacket around a habitat as part of radiation protection. Water would be efficiently recycled, but there is an initial load required.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;">There is plenty of water in the Solar System, but most of it is either on Earth (costly and environmentally damaging to source from) or in the outer regions, Asteroid Belt or beyond, requiring long and costly journeys. There is some on the Moon, but current evidence suggests not much. Fortunately there seems to be </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_on_Mars">masses of water on Mars,</a><span style="background-color: white;"> in polar ice caps or subsurface. Where there is water, there may be life, and this may include microbial life on Mars, although we have not discovered any yet. If so, we would have to make sure that any water extraction would not damage it.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">The most problematic essential element is <b>nitrogen</b>, 79% of an earth like atmosphere. While OK in a medical emergency<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;">,<a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/question493.htm"> breathing pure oxygen is bad for health</a></span> over a protracted period, and would be a huge fire risk. In any case, you need nitrogen to feed nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soil, essential for plant growth, and to produce artificial fertilisers. As with water, nitrogen is plentiful on Earth and in the outer solar system, not on the Moon, and amounts on Mars (as either gas or nitrates) do not seem plentiful, according to current knowledge. The best source seems to be Venus – only 3% of the atmosphere, but such is the high pressure of the atmosphere, that &nbsp;is more nitrogen than in the Earth’s atmosphere. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: white;">Elements that we need in trace amounts are <b>potassium, phosphorus, sodium</b> and<b> chlorine</b> (the latter two as common salt, sodium chloride). Rare on the Moon, but seemingly plentiful on Mars. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">For </span><b style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">building materials</b><span style="font-family: &quot;calibri&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%;">, you can make glass from regolith, and fused regolith makes a glassy building brick.
